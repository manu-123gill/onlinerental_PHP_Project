# vuejs

## When working with Vue.js, we can conveniently destructure object elements, just as we would in JavaScript. 
```sh
<script setup>
const users = [
  {
    name: "John Doe",
    id: "12345",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
    age: 30
  },
  {
    name: "Jane Smith",
    id: "67890",
    email: "jane.smith@example.com",
    age: 25
  }
];
</script>
